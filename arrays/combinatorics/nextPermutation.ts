/** The task was:
 *
 * A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.
 * For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are all the permutations of arr:
 * [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].
 * The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer.
 * More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order,
 * then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container.
 * If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order
 * (i.e., sorted in ascending order).
 * For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
 * Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
 * While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3]
 * because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.
 *
 * Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.
 * The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.

/**
 * It took me a while to wrap my head around the next lexicographical
 * permutation algorithm. But once I got it, the implementation only
 * took a few minutes.
 *
 * The core idea:
 * 1. Find the pivot. The pivot is the index of the first element
 *    (going from right to left) that is smaller than its neighbor to the right.
 * 2. Find the swap index. This is the index of the smallest element
 *    (scanning from the right) that is greater than the pivot value.
 * 3. Swap the pivot and the swap element.
 * 4. Finally, reverse the subarray starting at pivot + 1 to the end.
 * 
 * Notes:
 * While searching for the pivot, the suffix (to the right) ends up being
 * in descending order. Thatâ€™s why reversing it is safe.
 * Also, when finding the swap index, scanning from right to left ensures
 * that the first element greater than the pivot is the smallest such element.
